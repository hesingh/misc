Both `foo.h` and `.c` are snippets of code generated by p4 to vpp compiler.

First see `foo.h`.  `pkt_filter4` is a table defined in the P4 program.  The compiler is adding pkt_filter4_0 (never mind the _0) key, actions, and value.  "value" is the format
of table lookup result. 

Then, see `foo.c` which implements the data plane code related to this table. The table lookup uses `ubpf_map_lookup(&pkt_filter4_0, &key);` Based on "value" returned from 
table lookup, `value->action` runs the action.

How do we convert this C code to VPP's classify API (vnet_classify_add_del) or ACL API? Creating a classifier key is not a problem. It's how to map running one of two
actions on table hit?  On table miss, we run the `drop4()` action as VPP miss_next_action.
